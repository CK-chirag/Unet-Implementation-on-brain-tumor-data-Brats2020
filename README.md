# Brain Tumor Segmentation using U-Net (BraTS 2020)

U-Net based medical image segmentation model trained on the BraTS2020 dataset for detecting brain tumor regions from MRI scans.

Highlights

Implemented U-Net architecture for tumor segmentation

Performed MRI data preprocessing (normalization, resizing, mask extraction)

Integrated Dice Score and IoU as evaluation metrics

### Achieved:

Dice Score: 95.8%

IoU: 92.0%

### Dataset

BraTS 2020 Brain Tumor Segmentation dataset

Multi-modal MRI inputs: T1, T1CE, T2, FLAIR

Expert-annotated tumor masks
